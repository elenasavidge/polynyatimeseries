Code to reproduce figures in Savidge et al., XXXX.

Notebooks 'visible_effectivepixel_area' and 'thermal_effectivepixel_area' produce the data files (thermal_area_effectivepixel.pkl and visible_area_effectivepixel.pkl) that are  used in all the figure notebooks. These notebooks are quite large and take some time to run as they go through a total of 340 MODIS scenes.

Therefore, I include those output pickle files as well so that the 'visible_effectivepixel_area' and 'thermal_effectivepixel_area' notebooks do not need to be run to reproduce the figures.

Figures SX are supplemental figures.

All MODIS imagery can be visualized in NASA Worldview and downloaded from NASA Earthdata.
